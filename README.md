## About
Hi! I'm Asyifa and welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, explore and analyze, and visualize data to inform business decisions. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, BigQuery, Looker Studio, Excel, Google Cloud Storage. I have a good understanding of data analytics techniques, including, but not limited to, statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data mining, data management, dashboard building, report writing, critical thinking, and most importantly, communication to communicate my findings.

In this repository, I've included a variety of projects that showcase both my technical and analytical skills. You will find links to each project I've created. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for anyone to understand the insight and take action.
